 -- Starting hand: 12/13 Number of Players: 2
 -- NOTE: One random card will be missing from the deck at the beginning of the game. The card meant to pair with it is the "Old Maid". (EX: if a 4 is removed from the game, then one of the 3 4's is the OLD MAID).
 -- Computer Players:
       * Player 1: YOU!!!!!
       * Player 2: Random Num Generator picks a random number in your hand.
-- USER INTERACTION:
       * Player 2 dialogue: Either Pokemon ("I choose you... 3?!), YuGiOh ("I play a 3 pair in Defense Position!!!") or just randomly angry when near end ("PICK THE OLD MAID DAMMIT TAKE IT ALREADY!")

--Option to sort
-- Starting hand: 13 Number of Players: 4
-- Computer Players:
     * Player 1: Calls BS at random intervals, after a certain number of turns determined by random num generator
     * Player 2: Calls BS if the card's quantity in the middle pile has overcome 4 (aka, if 3 6's have been put in the middle pile, and another 2 6's have put into the middle pile, they call BS)
     * Player 3: Calls BS on the player with the least amount of cards after a certain number of turns. Will certainly call if only one card left (P3: "UNO!!!!"P2: "No, stupid, wrong game!"))
     * Player 4: YOU !!!!
     * All computer players will call BS if they hold 4 of a card that is being called.
